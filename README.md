### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
  
    After reading the documentation of the task I analysed the architectural design of the webite by identifying the
    multiple components and tasks
    
    required to create application
    
    List of Components and tasks
    
      Blue Nav Bar
      
      Black Nav Bar
      
      Footer
      
      Card view
      
      Home Screen
      
      Movie Screen
      
      Series Screen
      
      Requesting JSON data
      
      Filtering Data
      
      Loading and error handling
      
      According to The identified tasks and components the technical requirement came straignt through
     
      List of Technical Requirements and Libraries
  
      React for basic architecture
      
      React Router Dom  for routing between different components
      
      axios for JSON data fetching


### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

    There is always room for imporvement for any project . With discussion  and feedback surely
    we can identify the  problems (if any) in the application.


### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
    1. Add user  
    2. Add youtube link of trailer of those movies or series provided by json file and auto play them when mouse is hover over them
    3. Provide a random select button which selects the most appropriate and unwatched movie/series according to your genre 
    4. Adding a push Notification system for newly added shows and movies
